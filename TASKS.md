# Chrome Agent Platform tasks

`TASKS.md` is the repository-local, public-safe recovery record for product
feedback, bugs, reviews, and active delivery lanes. It complements, but never
copies, the private coordination ledger. The stable `CAP-FB-*` ID is the only
join key between the two systems.

> Snapshot: 2026-08-19 17:29 UTC. Reconcile before acting; status can advance in
> another reviewed worktree before this file reaches the integration branch.

## Safety boundary

This file is intended for a public repository. Never add credentials, personal
contact data, relay or provider message identifiers, agent session identifiers,
local absolute paths, private evidence locations, or private handoff IDs. Use a
model/role label for custody, a repository branch/ref, and Git object IDs.
Workspace paths and transport receipts stay in the private coordination ledger.

## Root documentation map

- `TASKS.md` — canonical delivery/task state and crash recovery.
- `KNOWN-ISSUES.md` — canonical review and system findings.
- `AGENTS.md`, `PLAN.md`, and `README.md` — repository-wide operating rules,
  roadmap, and overview; these correctly remain at the root.
- `docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/CONSTITUTION.md`, `docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`, and
  `docs/UI-FIXES-TRACKER.md` — scoped design/product records; these correctly
  remain under `docs/`.
- `docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md` — compatibility page only, linking to the root record.

## Entry schema

Every task uses every field below; use `—` rather than deleting a field.

```markdown
## [CAP-FB-YYYYMMDD-SLUG-NN] Title
- Feedback: YYYY-MM-DD — public-safe source and summary
- Updated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC
- Status: OPEN | IN_PROGRESS | FIX_REQUESTED | REVIEWING | REVIEW_PASSED | READY_FOR_BROWSER | INTEGRATING | GATED | PUSHED | BLOCKED | CONFIRMED | ABANDONED
- Resume: prior state when BLOCKED, otherwise —
- Priority: P0 | P1 | P2 | P3
- Owner: model/role | unassigned
- Workspace: active (local path private) | none
- Branch: repository branch/ref | detached candidate | none
- Base: commit | —
- Candidate: commit | this tracker commit | —
- Shipping: remote/ref@commit | —
- Acceptance: observable acceptance criteria
- Review: reviewer role and PASS/BLOCK/pending result
- Gates: exact-commit checks; label reported or independently verified
- Blockers: text | —
- Next: one concrete next action
- Recover: repository-relative Git commands or —
- History:
  - YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC — material event and evidence
```

IDs are immutable and never reused. The date is the feedback date; `NN`
disambiguates. Entries move intact to **Archive** after `CONFIRMED` or
`ABANDONED`; they are never deleted.

## State and evidence rules

- Normal flow is `OPEN → IN_PROGRESS → REVIEWING → REVIEW_PASSED →
  READY_FOR_BROWSER → INTEGRATING → GATED → PUSHED → CONFIRMED`. A review failure moves to
  `FIX_REQUESTED`; an external dependency moves to `BLOCKED` and records the
  exact `Resume` state.
- `READY_FOR_BROWSER` means source/static review passed but required browser or
  headed evidence has not. It is not final acceptance.
- `GATED` requires an exact candidate commit plus content-addressed gate evidence.
  `PUSHED` requires an immutable remote ref at that commit. `CONFIRMED` requires
  explicit product-owner confirmation. Never infer one state from another.
- Historical test counts prove only their named commit. Use `reported` when the
  current reviewer has not independently verified the evidence.

## Atomic ownership and updates

The **committed Git version** of this file is authoritative; line ordering in a
dirty working copy is not atomic.

1. Read the current tracker commit with `git log -1 --format=%H -- TASKS.md`.
2. To acquire or transfer custody, make one edit that changes `Owner`, `Updated`,
   `Next`, and appends one `ownership: old → new (reason)` History event. Commit
   that edit alone against the tracker commit read in step 1.
3. Ownership changes take effect only when that commit is accepted into the
   active integration ancestry. A competing commit is a compare-and-swap
   failure: re-read, reconcile, and retry; never silently overwrite it.
4. A material status, candidate, gate, blocker, or next-action update changes all
   affected fields and appends its evidence in the same commit. Reviewers may
   append a review event without taking implementation custody.
5. Automated writers must write a complete replacement file to a temporary file,
   flush it, and rename it; humans rely on the single Git commit as the atomic
   transaction. Never use “History first, fields later” as a crash guarantee.

## Crash recovery

On resume after a coordinator or worker loss:

1. Preserve before changing: run `git status --short`, `git diff -- TASKS.md`,
   and `git log -5 --oneline -- TASKS.md`. Never reset an interrupted draft.
2. Treat the last committed tracker version as authority. Save any dirty diff as
   a recovery patch outside the repository, then reconcile it entry by entry.
3. For every `IN_PROGRESS`, `FIX_REQUESTED`, `REVIEWING`, `READY_FOR_BROWSER`, or
   `INTEGRATING` entry, verify the recorded objects with
   `git cat-file -e <sha>^{commit}` and ancestry with
   `git merge-base --is-ancestor <base> <candidate>`. Use
   `git branch --contains <candidate>` only as a locator, not as acceptance.
4. Reconcile the stable task ID with the private coordination ledger. Publish
   only the public fields above. Authenticated commit/gate/remote evidence wins;
   otherwise retain the more conservative status.
5. If the candidate is missing, the branch diverged, ownership is ambiguous, or
   an uncommitted draft cannot be attributed, commit a transition to `BLOCKED`
   with `Resume`, recovery owner, blocker, one next action, and a `crash recovery
   audit` History event. Never guess or mark work complete.
6. Reconcile at least once per active workday and after any crash recovery. Log
   the timestamp in the reconciliation log below.

## [CAP-FB-20260818-ARTIFACT-TX-01] Transactional and owner-confirmed artifact management
- Feedback: 2026-08-18 — wider review found split body/index writes and destructive-operation authority gaps
- Updated: 2026-08-19 17:23 UTC
- Status: READY_FOR_BROWSER
- Resume: —
- Priority: P2
- Owner: release coordinator
- Workspace: active (local path private)
- Branch: `integrate/artifact-tx-4eaf0d3` (old-base reviewed candidate)
- Base: reviewed parent `d2d7fe825c396804b6bd4296c23d42e351bd98df`; required new target `ffbdf282013717b34c80c4a2135dd6fa8992f63a`
- Candidate: `263342689639c50c4eb6608602a8fb25ec7cd1de` (READY_FOR_BROWSER only on old base; not deliverable)
- Shipping: owner-approval half is an ancestor of `origin/main@ffbdf282013717b34c80c4a2135dd6fa8992f63a`; transaction half unshipped
- Acceptance: crash-safe body/index/WAL recovery, monotonic per-key absence authority, bounded repair, scoped access, and exact owner confirmation all compose on current main
- Review: gemini static review classified exact old-base `2633426` READY_FOR_BROWSER; fresh current-main integration review pending
- Gates: old-base integration reported full 579, artifact/memory 49, static security 19, build/gallery/parse; no current-main browser CRUD/recovery evidence
- Blockers: public main advanced; the reviewed full artifact range must be recreated and independently checked on `ffbdf28` before browser use
- Next: create one clean integration on `ffbdf28`, re-review exact bytes, then run loaded-MV3 CRUD/restart and broad Chrome journeys
- Recover: `git show --stat 2633426 && git show --stat ffbdf28`
- History:
  - 2026-08-18 20:18 UTC — split transactional storage from the separately reviewed approval correction.
  - 2026-08-19 16:23 UTC — complete reviewed five-commit source range froze as one old-main integration commit.
  - 2026-08-19 17:23 UTC — gemini static review classified `2633426` READY_FOR_BROWSER, but `origin/main` had advanced to `ffbdf28`; reintegration is mandatory before any browser or push claim.

## [CAP-FB-20260818-BOUNDS-01] Bounds, UTF-8, race, and accessibility backlog
- Feedback: 2026-08-18 — wider review found stale mutations, unbounded diagnostics, encoding, and accessibility gaps
- Updated: 2026-08-19 14:14 UTC
- Status: BLOCKED
- Resume: READY_FOR_BROWSER
- Priority: P3
- Owner: headed-environment operator
- Workspace: active (local path private)
- Branch: `fix/bounds-current-main`
- Base: `768225be1746c07605ed31aff697f3a6c8513224`
- Candidate: `cc68ba4685dca8cb05bf18a2d829707f3fac603c`
- Shipping: —
- Acceptance: all code/AX regressions pass and a genuine headed permission-prompt race produces trace and screenshot evidence without bypasses
- Review: code and accessibility review clear; headed witness unavailable
- Gates: reported focused 17, unit 533, security 7, Chrome 119, UI 65, sidebar 20, a11y 17, build/gallery/drift
- Blockers: a headed environment capable of the real permission prompt
- Next: run the one remaining real permission-race witness or obtain an explicit waiver
- Recover: `git show --stat cc68ba4 && git merge-base --is-ancestor 768225b cc68ba4`
- History:
  - 2026-08-18 20:18 UTC — opened from wider-review findings.
  - 2026-08-19 14:14 UTC — code and AX gates cleared; honestly blocked on the headed environment.

## [CAP-FB-20260818-SYSPROMPT-01] Versioned system-prompt settings
- Feedback: 2026-08-18 — system-prompt editing required protected runtime policy and upgrade-safe owner customization
- Updated: 2026-08-18 17:10 UTC
- Status: PUSHED
- Resume: —
- Priority: P3
- Owner: release coordinator
- Workspace: none
- Branch: `origin/main` history
- Base: —
- Candidate: `22fd2c04fea0465b6bbc081079af4f62acec8263`
- Shipping: `origin/main@22fd2c04fea0465b6bbc081079af4f62acec8263` (historical ancestor)
- Acceptance: effective prompt preview equals the sent prompt, protected constraints cannot be overridden, and upgrades never silently replace owner changes
- Review: independent review and integration gates passed
- Gates: historical unit 374, security 7, components 34, UI 13, system-prompt 44, Chrome 119, build/gallery
- Blockers: product-owner confirmation
- Next: obtain confirmation on current main
- Recover: `git show --stat 22fd2c0 && git merge-base --is-ancestor 22fd2c0 origin/main`
- History:
  - 2026-08-18 12:58 UTC — opened for versioned prompt customization.
  - 2026-08-18 17:10 UTC — reviewed integration pushed and remotely verified.

## Reconciliation log

- 2026-08-19 17:01 UTC — recovered the interrupted draft; reconciled stable CAP task IDs against the private coordination ledger, exact Git objects, current refs, and active worktree state. Public entries retain only role labels, repository refs, commit/evidence hashes, and conservative delivery states.
- 2026-08-19 17:07 UTC — reconciled after `origin/main` advanced to `ffbdf28`; run-status now records PUSHED, while the old-base Directory and artifact integrations explicitly require fresh current-main integrations.
- 2026-08-19 17:25 UTC — reconciled k3 tracker PASS, usage `d6030b7` REVIEW_PASSED, Assets successor `202b85e` REVIEWING, explicit gemini permission attribution, and old-base Directory/artifact READY_FOR_BROWSER classifications. No private coordination identifiers were copied.
