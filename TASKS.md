# Chrome Agent Platform tasks

`TASKS.md` is the repository-local, public-safe recovery record for product
feedback, bugs, reviews, and active delivery lanes. It complements, but never
copies, the private coordination ledger. The stable `CAP-FB-*` ID is the only
join key between the two systems.

> Snapshot: 2026-08-25 09:40 UTC. Reconciled against exact public
> `origin/main@cde116` after the archive split. This file holds the **active** set only;
> completed entries live in `TASKS-DONE.md`. Active counts: **32 nonterminal** and **1 terminal not yet archived**.
> See the Open work queue below; regenerate it rather than hand-editing the counts.

## Safety boundary

This file is intended for a public repository. Never add credentials, personal
contact data, relay or provider message identifiers, agent session identifiers,
local absolute paths, private evidence locations, or private handoff IDs. Use a
model/role label for custody, a repository branch/ref, and Git object IDs.
Workspace paths and transport receipts stay in the private coordination ledger.

## Root documentation map

- `TASKS.md` — canonical delivery/task state and crash recovery. Active work only.
- `TASKS-DONE.md` — completed entries archived out of `TASKS.md`, kept intact. IDs are
  unique across both files; look in both before concluding a task does not exist.
- `KNOWN-ISSUES.md` — canonical review and system findings.
- `REVIEW-2026-08-21.md` — the independent architectural review: verified baseline,
  the measured delivery diagnosis, the reproduced defects, and the ordered work queue.
  It is the rationale; this file is the contract. Never take work from it alone.
- `AGENTS.md`, `PLAN.md`, and `README.md` — repository-wide operating rules,
  roadmap, and overview; these correctly remain at the root.
- `docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/CONSTITUTION.md`, `docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`, and
  `docs/UI-FIXES-TRACKER.md` — scoped design/product records; these correctly
  remain under `docs/`.
- `docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md` — compatibility page only, linking to the root record.

## Entry schema

Every task uses every field below; use `—` rather than deleting a field. The one
exception is `Resume`, which records the state a `BLOCKED` entry may return to and
is required only there.

`scripts/check-tasks.mjs` (`npm run check:tasks`) enforces this schema across
`TASKS.md` and `TASKS-DONE.md`: exactly one of each field per heading, `Status` and
`Priority` inside the declared sets, and no id duplicated across the two files. It
carries a baseline of violations that predate it — the gate fails on anything new,
and `scripts/check-tasks-baseline.json` must only ever shrink.

## [CAP-FB-20260825-USAGE-AUTHORITY-PROBE-FAIL-01] usage-authority.test.ts PROBE-2/4 failing on main (usage-store CAS subsystem)

## [CAP-FB-YYYYMMDD-SLUG-NN] Title
- Feedback: YYYY-MM-DD — public-safe source and summary
- Updated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC
- Status: OPEN | IN_REVIEW | MERGED | DONE | BLOCKED | ABANDONED
- Resume: prior state when BLOCKED, otherwise —
- Priority: P0 | P1 | P2 | P3
- Owner: model/role | unassigned

- Blockers: text | —

```

IDs are immutable and never reused. The date is the feedback date; `NN`
disambiguates. Entries move intact to **Archive** after `DONE` or `ABANDONED`;
they are never deleted.

## State and evidence rules (Paul, 2026-08-21 — replaces the nine-state model)

Normal flow is **`OPEN → IN_REVIEW → MERGED → DONE`**, with `BLOCKED` and
`ABANDONED` as the two off-ramps.

- `OPEN` — not started, or being worked on. Leaves when a candidate commit exists
  and a reviewer is assigned.
- `IN_REVIEW` — a candidate exists and a **different model/session** is reviewing
  it. A failed review **stays** `IN_REVIEW` with the findings recorded in
  `Review`/`History`; it does not get its own state.
- `MERGED` — the candidate is on `origin/main`.
- `DONE` — merged **and** the Chrome journey suite green at that tip. Terminal.
  **`DONE` does not require a per-task product-owner interaction.** The previous
  model made the terminal state depend on explicit confirmation per task; the
  result was 0 of 31 tasks reaching it while this file grew without bound.
- `BLOCKED` — stopped on something external. Records an owner, the reason, one
  next action, and the `Resume` state.
- `ABANDONED` — will not be done. Records why. Terminal.

Two rules survive and are not negotiable: **a different model/session reviews
every change**, and **real-browser verification with evidence** — the 126-check
journey suite is a strong gate and it is sufficient. Content-addressed gate
evidence, live remote attestation and versioned acceptance packages are removed;
they produced 322 open handoff records and zero confirmations. Never fabricate
evidence or closure.

**A review is valid for its content, not its base.** If a candidate passed review
and `main` advanced without touching the same files, the review still stands —
rebase and land it. Re-review only what actually changed.

Historical test counts prove only their named commit. Use `reported` when the
current reviewer has not independently verified the evidence.

Entries written under the previous model are **not** rewritten. Read them through
this mapping: `IN_PROGRESS`/`FIX_REQUESTED` → `OPEN`;
`REVIEWING`/`REVIEW_PASSED`/`READY_FOR_BROWSER`/`INTEGRATING`/`GATED` →
`IN_REVIEW`; `PUSHED` → `MERGED`; `CONFIRMED` → `DONE`.

## Atomic ownership and updates

The **committed Git version** of this file is authoritative; line ordering in a
dirty working copy is not atomic.

1. Read the current tracker commit with `git log -1 --format=%H -- TASKS.md`.
2. To acquire or transfer custody, make one edit that changes `Owner`, `Updated`,
   `Next`, and appends one `ownership: old → new (reason)` History event. Commit
   that edit alone against the tracker commit read in step 1.
3. Ownership changes take effect only when that commit is accepted into the
   active integration ancestry. A competing commit is a compare-and-swap
   failure: re-read, reconcile, and retry; never silently overwrite it.
4. A material status, candidate, gate, blocker, or next-action update changes all
   affected fields and appends its evidence in the same commit. Reviewers may
   append a review event without taking implementation custody.
5. Automated writers must write a complete replacement file to a temporary file,
   flush it, and rename it; humans rely on the single Git commit as the atomic
   transaction. Never use “History first, fields later” as a crash guarantee.

## Crash recovery

On resume after a coordinator or worker loss:

1. Preserve before changing: run `git status --short`, `git diff -- TASKS.md`,
   and `git log -5 --oneline -- TASKS.md`. Never reset an interrupted draft.
2. Treat the last committed tracker version as authority. Save any dirty diff as
   a recovery patch outside the repository, then reconcile it entry by entry.
3. For every `IN_PROGRESS`, `FIX_REQUESTED`, `REVIEWING`, `READY_FOR_BROWSER`, or
   `INTEGRATING` entry, verify the recorded objects with
   `git cat-file -e <sha>^{commit}` and ancestry with
   `git merge-base --is-ancestor <base> <candidate>`. Use
   `git branch --contains <candidate>` only as a locator, not as acceptance.
4. Reconcile the stable task ID with the private coordination ledger. Publish
   only the public fields above. Authenticated commit/gate/remote evidence wins;
   otherwise retain the more conservative status.
5. If the candidate is missing, the branch diverged, ownership is ambiguous, or
   an uncommitted draft cannot be attributed, commit a transition to `BLOCKED`
   with `Resume`, recovery owner, blocker, one next action, and a `crash recovery
   audit` History event. Never guess or mark work complete.
6. Reconcile at least once per active workday and after any crash recovery. Log
   the timestamp in the reconciliation log below.

## Open work queue

Every task in this file that is not in a terminal state, most urgent first. **32 open**. The entry itself is always the authority; where it disagrees with this table, the entry wins.

Regenerate after any status change (this exact command reproduces the table below):

```sh
awk '/^## \[CAP-FB/{h=$0; sub(/^## \[/,"",h); id=h; sub(/\].*/,"",id); t=h; sub(/^[^]]*\] */,"",t)} /^- Status:/{s=$3} /^- Priority:/{if(s!="DONE"&&s!="MERGED"&&s!="ABANDONED"&&id!~/YYYYMMDD/) printf "%-3s %-10s %s — %s\n",$3,s,id,t}' TASKS.md | sort

## [CAP-FB-20260823-COMPREHENSIVE-CHROME-TOOLS-01] Comprehensive Chrome extension API tool coverage

- Feedback: 2026-08-23 — product owner (early request, still missing): the
  browser tools are NOT a comprehensive set of Chrome extension APIs. The
  tool is supposed to manage the entire browser, so the Chrome extension APIs
  should be available as tools. Missing examples named: chrome.action
  (icon/badge/background colour), alarms, bookmarks, downloads, contextMenus,
  commands, idle, notifications, pageCapture, permissions, readingList,
  scripting, sidePanel, system.memory, system.display, system.cpu, windows
  (create/manage), tabGroups, topSites. Example: a "sorting hat" background
  agent needs tabGroups but there's no tabGroups tool. The existing
  management tools are liked; the rest is missing

  (action, alarms, bookmarks, downloads, contextMenus, commands, idle,
  notifications, pageCapture, permissions, readingList, scripting, sidePanel,
  system.*, windows, tabGroups, topSites) become bounded, permission-gated
  tools with truthful schemas; each respects the owner-permission model and

  - 2026-08-23 21:20 UTC — diagnosis: the ONLY generator was the edit-dialog
    "Regenerate avatar" button (named-agent.avatar returns a preview; the icon
    persisted only when the owner clicked). Fix: `generateAvatarForCreatedAgent`
    (lib/named-agents.js, dependency-injected + time-bounded 20s) runs as a
    bounded immediate follow-up inside the SW `named-agent.create` handler —
    never blocking the create response, only when the created agent has no
    avatar, persisting ONLY if the stored agent still has none (a concurrent
    owner edit always wins). No key / generation failure / timeout / agent
    gone → avatar stays null and every render surface keeps the deterministic
    initialAvatar placeholder (data:image/svg+xml — never a broken image,
    existing onerror fallback unchanged). Storage bounded: the existing
    128px-JPEG downscale. Covers BOTH creation paths (UI dialog + the model's
    named_agent.create management tool — same route). Gates:

## [CAP-FB-20260819-PROACTIVE-TAB-DISCOVERY-01] Proactive per-tab Site Agent discovery before Run
- Feedback: 2026-08-19 — before Run, the product should show what a selected tab is likely or verified to offer instead of waiting for a blind execution attempt

- Candidate: —
- Shipping: —
- Acceptance: before Run, each selected tab shows bounded known or probable tool count, capability summary, injectability, owner-visible screenshot or description when authorized, current page state, and observation timestamp; heuristic/probable data is visually and accessibly distinct from verified discovery and stale data cannot authorize execution
- Review: pending independent privacy, permission, freshness, heuristic-truth, accessibility, and loaded-MV3 review
- Gates: deterministic heuristic-versus-verified units; selected-tab navigation/reload/injectability/permission matrix; screenshot/description provenance and bounds; stale timestamp fencing; raw AX labels; narrow/RTL/theme screenshots; no automatic broad permission request
- Blockers: implementation is blocked on the page/document/toolset identity contract in `CAP-FB-20260819-PAGE-SCOPED-SITE-IDENTITY-01` and owner-driven permission behavior in `CAP-FB-20260819-PERMISSIONS-01`

- Candidate: —
- Shipping: —
- Acceptance: every listed tool has a bounded truthful description, input schema summary, useful metadata, and its source page URL, title, and origin; Declared and Approved controls remain contained in and accessibly labelled to the exact tool; pages or sites with zero verified tools are excluded; the enrollment-versus-per-tool-approval policy is documented as an explicit researched decision rather than inferred from feedback
- Review: research and product-policy decision pending before implementation; subsequent independent security, permissions, information-architecture, accessibility, and loaded-MV3 review required
- Gates: prior-art and threat-model note; policy decision record; production-registry fixtures with multiple pages/tools and zero-tool exclusions; tool-card containment and exact AX labels; page URL/title/origin provenance; narrow/RTL/theme screenshots; enrollment and per-tool approval journeys matching the chosen policy
- Blockers: implementation must not start until research distinguishes agent enrollment authority from per-tool invocation approval and records the product decision; page provenance depends on `CAP-FB-20260819-PAGE-SCOPED-SITE-IDENTITY-01`
- Next: research enrollment and per-tool approval models, document trade-offs and abuse cases, and obtain an explicit product decision before designing controls

- Candidate: —
- Shipping: —
- Acceptance: the intermittent flash is reproducible or boundedly classified with synchronized recording and screenshots; CDP evidence distinguishes layout shift, full rerender, stylesheet/font/theme reload, iframe or screenshot artifact, view transition, navigation, and service-worker/state replacement; a demonstrated root cause is fixed and a browser regression proves no whole-UI flash under the reproducing sequence
- Review: research-first reproduction and trace analysis pending; any correction requires independent performance, rendering, accessibility, and exact loaded-MV3 review
- Gates: repeated fresh-profile NTP/chat/options/Directory/Assets/view-switch journeys; video or frame sequence with timestamps; Performance and tracing events; layout-shift rectangles; DOM/style/theme/font/navigation/view-transition mutation timeline; console/runtime/network logs; before/after screenshots; root-cause-specific regression with a visible no-flash oracle
- Blockers: no correction should be selected until evidence identifies the owning layer and excludes capture-only artifacts; intermittent reproduction may require a bounded matrix across routes, themes, viewport sizes, and service-worker restarts
- Next: build a read-only reproduction harness that records synchronized screenshots, CDP trace domains, DOM mutation markers, theme/style/font loads, navigation, view-transition events, and service-worker lifecycle before proposing a fix

## [CAP-FB-20260819-PERMISSION-REMEDIATION-UX-01] User-facing permission management and run remediation
- Feedback: 2026-08-19 — permission failures need truthful owner-facing diagnosis, least-privilege remediation, and deterministic run continuation rather than vague missing-permission messages

- Candidate: —
- Shipping: —
- Acceptance: Settings reflects actual Chrome optional permissions and site access separately from agent/task policy; a failed run names the exact tool, capability, origin, rationale, and least-privilege choices instead of a vague `<all_urls>` or permission error; the run pauses safely, creates a visible owner-only approval prompt or inbox item, grants only through a genuine browser gesture, and deterministically resumes the same run or records deny, cancel, revoke, and retry outcomes; pending and error history remains discoverable
- Review: pending independent permission-model, owner-authority, privacy, recovery, Settings-synchronization, accessibility, and loaded-MV3 review of `docs/permission-remediation-design.md`
- Gates: exact-host, activeTab, optional capability, and `<all_urls>` denial/remediation matrix; genuine Settings and browser permission gestures; agent/task policy versus Chrome-state assertions; owner-only prompt and inbox AX/keyboard checks; view changes, tab reopen, service-worker restart, deny/cancel/revoke/retry, same-run resume, stale-owner fencing, and synchronized Settings screenshots
- Blockers: must build on, but remain a separate user-facing workstream from, `CAP-FB-20260819-PERMISSIONS-01`; no implementation may make permission grants model-callable, silently broaden site access, or blanket-grant `<all_urls>`
- Next: design the owner-only inbox + paused-run resume state machine from `docs/permission-remediation-design.md` under the settled policy — grants remembered at the narrowest practical scope, no per-invocation prompts, explicit broad host grant allowed and revocable; recoverable permission problems pause visibly and resume after resolution
- Recover: `git show bbeff7b:TASKS.md && git grep -n "permissions.request\|optional_permissions\|all_urls" bbeff7b -- extension`
- History:
  - Git reconcile at 2026-08-22 07:50 UTC: the agent/task permission policy layer is settled per the recorded project history — see the durable interruption/permissions policy (auto-resume on restart, visible pause + resume for recoverable permission problems, terminal explicit cancellation, narrowest-scope remembered grants, no per-invocation prompts, explicit broad host grant allowed and revocable).
  - Git reconcile at 2026-08-22 07:30 UTC: legacy state `OPEN` mapped to `OPEN` (unchanged semantics).
  - 2026-08-19 19:40 UTC — fourth docs-review correction applied: the source-map intro is now the bounded "known user-visible sources observed during this review; not formal/exhaustive" wording, and the duplicate row-15 numbering is fixed.
  - 2026-08-19 19:37 UTC — third docs-review correction applied: added the shared/components.js:4548 role=status storage-permission source to the map and removed the prior History "corrected/completed" wording (no premature complete-map claim).
  - 2026-08-19 19:30 UTC — second docs-review corrections applied: the paused-run state machine now stops at the neutral `GRANTED_WAITING_RESUME_POLICY` state and branches BOTH open resume alternatives (no unconditional grant→RUNNING); the source map adds the conversation.js:395-449 inline retry + error-report.js:44-45 generic permission presentation and corrects the early provider gate to service-worker.js:1195-1203 + provider-gate.js:115-131; History no longer claims a complete map.
  - 2026-08-19 18:40 UTC — docs review BLOCK corrections applied: auto-resume vs explicit Resume left as two OPEN alternatives (neither normative); the source map corrected (global/origins scope labels, activeTab-or-tabs, injectScriptsIntoOpenTabs, scheduler/enrollment/options/ntp/components sources); activeTab is a target-tab invocation journey (not a Settings button); exact-origin is the minimum persistent host grant with narrowing in the policy layer only; <all_urls> is not declared and not a current choice; the Permissions lane is labeled an unshipped candidate; multi-run ordering and distinct DENIED vs CANCELLED defined; Updated timestamp reconciled.
  - 2026-08-19 18:40 UTC — public-safe research/design report added as `docs/permission-remediation-design.md` (maps the 12 missing-permission/error sources + Settings surfaces, separates Chrome optional/site state from agent/task policy, and designs the owner-only inbox, the paused-run resume state machine, deny/cancel/revoke/retry, the threat model, and loaded-MV3 fixtures). Auto-resume and one-shot JIT continuation remain explicitly unapproved.
  - 2026-08-19 18:17 UTC — opened as a distinct Settings and run-remediation UX task; the existing orchestration candidate remains linked and is not treated as user-facing acceptance.

  lazy discovery, owner-facing Tool Library, policy-separated owner install,
  spreadsheet/data workflows and continuous abuse gates without weakening
  existing owner grants, source dispatch, optional permissions,
  run/origin/agent/document/generation fences or replay safety
- Review: independent architecture/security/replay/privacy/Store-policy review
  at each dependency boundary plus different-session source and exact loaded-MV3
  review for every executable or UI slice
- Gates: all 13 split tasks below satisfy their own gates in dependency order;
  exact merged tip passes full unit/security/canonical Chrome, provider
  nondisclosure, source revocation, credential/network capture, Store/RHC scan
  and provenance/licence review
- Blockers: owner-selected Wasm in a Chrome Web Store build remains blocked on
  written remotely hosted code policy; Co-do's Apache-2.0 root versus MIT
  package/generated-manifest metadata and per-binary provenance are unresolved;
  runtime/resource numbers require loaded-MV3 measurements

- Shipping: —
- Acceptance: an isolated loaded-MV3 experiment proves or rejects bundled Wasm
  compilation under shipped CSP, offscreen-hosted fresh dedicated Workers,
  Worker termination of an infinite loop, declared memory maxima, import
  inspection, OPFS access strategy, service-worker/offscreen interruption and
  zero main-thread fallback without changing production grants or installing
  packages
- Review: independent MV3/CSP/isolation/resource/cleanup review of the immutable
  probe and evidence required
- Gates: source/self-test candidate 19/19; exact bundled fixture hashes;
  permitted/forbidden import matrix; infinite-loop deadline; memory
  growth/compile bomb; Worker/offscreen/service-worker termination; OPFS
  read/write isolation; console/CSP/network capture; no surviving Worker/profile;
  canonical Chrome only under the serialized lock. `npm run test:security` is
  DEFERRED because it launches unsynchronized Chromium; one prior unlocked
  invocation is INVALID noncanonical evidence, not a product result
- Blockers: the reviewed serialized run reached the loaded extension but the
  driver sent `runtime.sendMessage` from the service worker to itself; Chrome
  does not deliver that message back to the same worker listener, so the first
  response was empty and all Wasm/isolation/OPFS rows were HARNESS failures.
  The driver also lacks fail-fast/failed-run receipts, accepts restart
  classification without a responsive replacement worker, misnames its JSON
  hash manifest `.sha256`, and removes `run-init.json` on non-zero completion.
  No Wasm runtime product result was observed
- Next: parked. A successor must directly invoke the registered test route in
  the service-worker context, fail fast with a durable receipt, require a
  rotated and responsive replacement for restart PASS, retain failed-run init
  evidence, and pass a new independent source/custody review before one newly
  authorized serialized run

- History:
  - 2026-08-22 09:30 UTC — opened as the second owner-decision-free technical
    proof; Co-do's Worker/main-thread behavior is precedent only and cannot
    substitute for loaded-MV3 evidence.
  - 2026-08-22 10:16 UTC — candidate `cab69d2` passed final source/custody review;
    its sole authorized run recorded 1 PASS / 9 FAIL with screenshot, AX,
    redacted telemetry and valid hashes. Independent review classified the
    failures as HARNESS plus minor EVIDENCE defects, not Wasm product failures,
    because the driver self-messaged the service worker and never reached the
    registered runtime route. The candidate is parked; no retry or shipping.

    works on any fresh checkout with zero /tmp dependency; total scrub of
    /tmp and absolute build-host paths from all shipped bytes (owner
    directive); repair commits restored the gitignored d3/sqlite3 dist
    binaries and the dist marker.
  - 2026-08-24 17:45 UTC — R12 sqlite3_query_bounded admission LANDED as
    0.2.228 (origin/main@5161c6963e0ea6e2321dffb375041f7ae588cd24): the 26th
    enabled tool — 26/0 posture, ALL 26 bundled Wasm tools enabled. Browser
    gate PASS (sqlite preview runs SELECT 1 in a real browser). SQLite WASI
    train COMPLETE.
  - 2026-08-24 16:00 UTC — the full sqlite WASI runtime LANDED as 0.2.227
    (origin/main@4c6cca287d87d20fa12a69a128a84403bb3cdbb8): the S2 scratch

    six imports (fd_sync, mkdir, rmdir, unlink, readlink stub, poll stub);
    SUPPORTED 20→28; sqlite3 admission (R12) is the last step to 26/26.

    touch/truncate/sqlite3 admissions remain next per the plan.
  - 2026-08-23 22:00 UTC — build integrity landed as 0.2.191 (45ca99f):
    `npm run build` runs the package generator in verify mode by default
    (fail-closed zero-drift over all 80 generated outputs) with full
    regeneration only behind explicit --regen-tools; 1265/1265 full suite;
    rebase conflict resolution dogfooded byte-exact (regen left zero diff).
  - 2026-08-22 09:30 UTC — factual Co-do inventory recorded as 39 tools across
    nine functional categories; it is a prioritization precedent, not a binary
    source.

  keyed and idempotent; capacity failure reports the missing aggregate
  reservation/refcount/orphan-GC policy without deleting or evicting anything;
  bounded summary/schema/row/cell previews are inert non-authoritative data;
  apply/reject/undo/patched-CSV export refuse before input access
- Review: integration design independently PASSed; exact source candidate review
  pending
- Gates: focused canonical K-BASE/O-BASE, Unicode/chunk/content boundaries through
  exact one MiB, identity mutants, hostile proxies/accessors, manifest-last,
  readback corruption/missing/reordered chunks, retry/interruption/capacity orphan
  accounting, preview control/formula/scalar-safe truncation, no-truncation and
  static no-route/no-OPFS/no-code-diff/no-mutation import graph; exact source
  candidate passed focused 12/12, full no-Chrome 1041/1041 across 14 steps and
  the 112-file production-JS build with zero bundled Wasm binaries
- Blockers: existing asset API has no grouped capacity reservation, refcount or
  orphan collector, so this adapter remains unreachable; any route/runtime/UI,
  artifact access-control acceptance, grouped promotion/GC or table mutation is
  a separately reviewed successor

## [CAP-FB-20260822-OWNER-WASM-INSTALL-01] Owner-selected Wasm package lifecycle

- Candidate: this tracker commit
- Shipping: —
- Acceptance: an explicit owner-selected file enters staged validation,
  provenance/signature/licence/SBOM and capability/version diff review, then
  atomic install/update/revoke; grants key exact immutable
  package/tool/version/executable/capability identity and never survive relevant
  change; model/page cannot install, update, trust a signer or grant capability
- Review: independent Store/RHC legal-policy, supply-chain, owner-gesture,
  package transaction, grant, accessibility and loaded-MV3 review required
- Gates: credential-free Store precursor requires marker-v2 exact target,
  legacy/cross-target refusal, exact CSP, tracked/generated scanner, empty Worker
  allowlist, zero unmanifested Wasm and exact archive parity; owner cancel/deny,
  malformed/archive-bomb/substitution/signature/revocation/update, grant
  invalidation, concurrent install, crash recovery, offline restart, no
  network/provider credentials, written RHC decision and owner-package-specific
  packaging remain separate
- Blockers: Chrome Web Store execution of owner-uploaded/downloaded Wasm
  requires written policy clearance; until then this is limited to a separately
  packaged unpacked/enterprise/developer lane and Store mode remains
  bundled-only
- Next: obtain the distribution-policy determination after package authority and
  Tool Library review; do not add owner execution to the Store build meanwhile
- Recover:
  `git grep -n "OWNER-WASM-INSTALL\|owner-selected\|remotely hosted code\|Store lane" -- TASKS.md docs extension tests`
- History:
  - 2026-08-22 09:30 UTC — intentionally BLOCKED at the distribution boundary;
    digests, signatures and an owner click are not treated as automatic
    Store-policy clearance.
  - 2026-08-22 20:12 UTC — added only the credential-free Store package/static
    precursor over exact public `0.2.157`: target intent and scanner evidence do
    not clear written-policy, owner gesture, signer, install or execution gates.

## [CAP-FB-20260820-SEMANTIC-TOOL-SEARCH-01] Local semantic search over the complete tool catalog

  WebMCP-relay/Modern-Web-Guidance-style retrieval so the model receives only

- Candidate: —
- Shipping: —
- Acceptance: one local versioned catalog indexes every callable built-in tool,
  extension-provided tool, declared WebMCP tool and positively inferred WebMCP
  tool with stable source, scope, generation/document identity, bounded
  description, schema summary and searchable text; each run retrieves a bounded
  top-k set by semantic/cosine relevance plus deterministic exact-name/alias and
  lexical fallback, and only that authorized set is exposed to the model;
  retrieval never grants permission, bypasses source-specific dispatch, crosses
  origin/agent boundaries, revives removed tools, or lets untrusted tool text
  alter ranking policy or protected prompts; index updates, removals, extension
  upgrades, navigation, service-worker restart and offline startup converge
  without sending the whole catalog; owner diagnostics explain selected,
  excluded, stale and fallback results without exposing secrets or private data
- Review: P0 tool-platform research fixes this as the sole semantic-retrieval
  authority; the catalog contract's deterministic exact/alias/lexical fallback
  is a prerequisite, not a duplicate semantic engine; independent architecture,
  retrieval-quality, security/privacy, lifecycle, performance and exact
  loaded-MV3 review required before semantic implementation acceptance
- Gates: compare SQLite/Wasm and IndexedDB storage/indexing under MV3 CSP,
  worker lifetime, migration, quota and crash semantics; compare local embedding
  choices, dimensions, update cost and deterministic lexical fallback; build a
  versioned bounded corpus spanning all four tool sources with
  relevance/precision/recall and token-budget targets plus measured budgets for
  catalog-scale warm-query latency, cold/offline startup, full index build,
  incremental add/update/remove, persisted index bytes and peak memory;
  establish explicit device/corpus tiers and pass/fail budgets during research
  before implementation; exact-name, paraphrase, multi-intent, low-confidence,
  collision and no-match queries; adversarial
  descriptions/schema/prompt-injection and oversized/Unicode fixtures;
  source/generation/origin/permission fencing;
  add/update/remove/navigation/restart/offline/corruption recovery; loaded-MV3
  proof that only selected descriptors reach the provider while non-selected
  tools remain undisclosed and uncallable
- Blockers: embedding model/runtime, ranking thresholds/top-k/token budget,
  semantic storage engine (SQLite versus IndexedDB), device tiers, update
  authority, telemetry and embedding provenance remain OPEN; the lexical shadow
  slice selects none of them; the design must compose with
  `CAP-FB-20260822-TOOL-CATALOG-CONTRACT-01`,
  `CAP-FB-20260822-LAZY-TOOL-PROTOCOL-01`, `CAP-FB-20260818-WEBMCP-01`, page
  identity, canonical agent references and permission remediation
- Next: measure candidate local embedding/index implementations against the
  bounded canonical catalog and lexical baseline, then record the
  engine/storage/device-tier decision before adding semantic ranking
- Recover:
  `git show ecf657f:TASKS.md && git grep -n "toolSetForOrigin\|MANAGEMENT_TOOL\|browserTools\|webmcpExpose\|document.modelContext" ecf657f -- extension`

  - 2026-08-22 09:30 UTC — Paul elevated the Co-do-style tool operating platform
    and this existing semantic-retrieval task to P0. The ID remains
    authoritative and unique; the new catalog slice implements only the required
    deterministic lexical baseline and makes no embedding/SQLite choice.
  - Git reconcile at 2026-08-22 07:30 UTC: legacy state `OPEN` mapped to `OPEN`
    (unchanged semantics).
  - 2026-08-20 15:21 UTC — opened as research-first semantic tool retrieval
    across built-in, extension, declared WebMCP and inferred WebMCP sources; no
    database, embedding model, threshold or runtime was inferred from the
    request.

## [CAP-FB-20260821-WORKTREE-HYGIENE-01] Durable worktrees and evidence off the RAM-backed temp filesystem
- Feedback: 2026-08-21 — independent architectural review found the build host's temporary filesystem at 100% inode use, which failed the unit suite, and found reviewed work and retained gate evidence stored only on tmpfs

- Branch: none
- Base: `cdc1a657e3907e018ba8fb33de066aec95bd9596`
- Candidate: —
- Shipping: —
- Acceptance: the build host's temporary filesystem reports headroom sufficient to run the full unit and Chrome journey suites without an `ENOSPC`/inode failure; no git worktree and no retained gate-evidence bundle referenced by any `Gates:` field in this tracker resides on a RAM-backed filesystem; every worktree HEAD is reachable from a branch or an explicit rescue tag before that worktree is removed; worktrees holding no commits beyond `origin/main` are removed and `git worktree prune` reports a clean list; a written convention records where worktrees and evidence live and is added to `AGENTS.md`
- Review: independent verification that no commit reachable only from a removed worktree was lost, by comparing the pre-removal HEAD set against branch and tag reachability
- Gates: pre-removal inventory of every worktree HEAD with reachability classification; `df -i` before and after; `git worktree list` and `git worktree prune` output; `git fsck --unreachable` diff showing no newly unreachable commit; full unit suite green on the reclaimed host
- Blockers: the dirty worktrees (tracked + untracked changes) must be preserved or consciously reconciled first; the durable/tmpfs relocation of the remaining worktrees is deferred until then
- Next: Residual: no candidate commit exists; the 18 dirty worktrees (tracked + untracked) must be preserved or consciously reconciled before any destructive cleanup, and the durable/tmpfs relocation is deferred until then. Next action: run `node scripts/worktree-audit.mjs` (read-only), agree the dirty-preservation plan with the owner, then (a) remove the clean worktrees holding nothing beyond origin/main + `git worktree prune`, (b) bind the unreachable detached heads under `rescue/*` tags, (c) move the durable evidence off the RAM-backed tmpfs.
- Recover: `git worktree list --porcelain && git tag -l 'rescue/*' && git fsck --unreachable`
- History:
  - 2026-08-22 — the public-safe AGENTS.md convention + the read-only worktree-audit script shipped; the audit inventories every registered worktree (HEAD/branch/dirty tracked+untracked/reachability/rescue/location class) and refuses destructive operations; private paths stay out of the repo.
  - Git reconcile at 2026-08-22 07:50 UTC: VERIFIED current facts — after the prior cleanup 19 worktrees remained (18 dirty, preserved, + the clean main worktree); two clean worktrees were later added for the tracker and the product work, so the current 21 = 18 dirty + 3 clean; 151 tracked changes + 26 untracked paths sit in the dirty worktrees; the cleanup removed 133 clean worktrees and 126 obsolete local branches, left 10 rescue tags, and touched no remote refs. No further destructive action until the dirty-preservation decisions.
  - Git reconcile at 2026-08-22 07:30 UTC: legacy state `OPEN` mapped to `OPEN` (unchanged semantics).
  - 2026-08-21 09:55 UTC — opened from the independent architectural review (`REVIEW-2026-08-21.md` §3 D1/D2). Seven at-risk commits were tagged `rescue/tmp-detached-*` locally before this entry was written; no worktree, branch, or object was deleted.

  - 2026-08-23 20:12 UTC — sweep: no candidate (Candidate —); the prior cleanup left 18 dirty + 3 clean worktrees and 10 rescue tags; no further destructive action is warranted.

- Acceptance: one vocabulary is used end to end — directory names, module names, exported symbols, route names, slash commands, autocomplete entries, UI copy, tests and documentation; a repository-wide grep for the retired term returns only intentional historical references in changelog or archive entries; stored user data written under the old naming continues to load, or a stated migration converts it
- Review: independent cross-subsystem review covering the composer, command registry, autocomplete, settings, hub and gallery
- Gates: full unit suite, `scripts/chrome-journeys.ts`, `npm run check:gallery` and `npm run test:components` green; a repository-wide grep for the retired term with each remaining hit justified; a loaded-MV3 pass over every surface that names the concept; a fixture proving pre-rename stored data still loads
- Blockers: the couplings named in `AGENTS.md` — composer, command registry, autocomplete, skills/agents registry — must all be updated together; a partial rename is what produced this entry

- Acceptance: an owner can export a single portable bundle covering named/background/site agents, their per-agent OPFS memory and run history, threads, artifacts, skills, scheduled tasks and non-secret settings, from a genuine owner gesture in Settings; the bundle is inspectable (documented format, not an opaque blob) and states plainly what it excludes; import restores into a clean profile with the same agent identities, memory contents and artifact references, or reports exactly what could not be restored and why; **provider API keys are never included** — the bundle records which providers were configured, never their secrets; import is transactional and never partially overwrites existing data without an explicit owner choice; export works with zero optional permissions granted or states clearly which grant it needs
- Review: independent security/privacy review of what the bundle contains (a full memory export is a high-value exfiltration target and must not be model-callable), plus data-integrity, transaction, and loaded-MV3 review
- Gates: round-trip fixture — build a profile with several agents, memories, threads and artifacts, export, wipe, import, assert identity-level equality; assert no credential material anywhere in the bundle bytes; assert export and import are unreachable from any model toolset; partial-failure and corrupt-bundle handling; large-bundle bounds; service-worker restart mid-export
- Blockers: must compose with the deletion transaction in `CAP-FB-20260819-AGENT-DELETION-LIFECYCLE-01` and the artifact custody rules in `CAP-FB-20260818-ARTIFACT-TX-01`; the bundle format is a versioned contract and needs to be right the first time
- Next: inventory every durable store the extension writes (per-agent OPFS tiers, master memory, `chrome.storage` keys, IndexedDB usage ledger, artifact bodies) and write the bundle format contract before any UI

- History:

## [CAP-FB-20260825-WEBSTORE-RELEASE-01] The path to a published extension

- Acceptance: a decided final name applied consistently across the manifest, every UI surface, the documentation and the repository; a store listing with description, screenshots and category; a privacy policy that accurately describes what the extension stores locally and what it sends to a provider; a written justification for every optional permission and host permission in the manifest, each traceable to the feature that needs it; a store-mode build produced by the existing archive path and validated by `scripts/validate-package-load.ts`; a documented plan for responding to a review rejection
- Review: independent review of the permission justifications against the actual code (a justification that overstates or understates what a permission is used for is a rejection risk and a trust problem), and of the privacy policy against the real data flows
- Gates: name consistency grep across manifest, UI strings, docs and README; every `optional_permissions` and `optional_host_permissions` entry mapped to a calling site; store-mode archive builds and loads clean; privacy policy cross-checked against every network call the extension can make
- Blockers: the final name and distribution channel are undecided — `docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md` Q11 (tracked in `CAP-FB-20260825-OWNER-DECISION-QUEUE-01`). The owner-selected Wasm policy question (Q13) determines whether Store mode ships bundled-only; do not resolve it inside this task

- Acceptance: from a fresh profile, an owner reaches a working site-agent tool call in under a minute without reading documentation — a reachable entry point, at least one real origin whose WebMCP tools are discovered and invoked, and a visible result; the path states honestly what it granted and to which origin; nothing about the demonstration weakens origin isolation, per-tool first-run approval or the all-optional permission model; the fixture origin in `fixtures/` is usable for this without pretending to be a third-party site
- Review: independent product, security and first-run review; a demonstration path that quietly broadens access to make itself smooth is a failure, not a success
- Gates: fresh-profile loaded-MV3 walkthrough timed end to end, with screenshots at each step; assert the exact permissions requested and that none is granted without a gesture; assert per-tool approval still fires; the same path re-run after a service-worker restart
- Blockers: depends on page identity from `CAP-FB-20260819-PAGE-SCOPED-SITE-IDENTITY-01` and the discovery/enrollment vocabulary in `CAP-FB-20260819-DIRECTORY-TOOL-EXPLORER-01`; sequence after those rather than duplicating their decisions

- Acceptance: a documented, repeatable headed run that covers the three gaps currently recorded as permanently open — (a) a screenshot success path, since headless auto-denies arbitrary-tab capture; (b) one full enrollment lifecycle as a single journey: enroll, discover, invoke, clean up, retry; (c) the two WebMCP operating-system permission prompts from `docs/WEBMCP-ACCEPTANCE.md`. The run states plainly which steps needed a human click and which were automated; its evidence is written to durable storage, never to a RAM-backed filesystem; a headless run continues to pass unchanged and continues to assert fail-closed behaviour
- Review: independent review that the headed path exercises production code rather than a test-only shortcut — the round-28 WebMCP block was caused by acceptance that bypassed the implementation
- Gates: the headed run itself, with retained screenshots; the existing headless suites still green and still asserting fail-closed denial; explicit labelling of every manual gesture
- Blockers: needs a machine with a display. If none is available, that must be recorded as the blocker with a named owner rather than leaving three residuals permanently open in `KNOWN-ISSUES.md`
- Next: confirm whether a headed environment is available at all; if not, mark this `BLOCKED` with that owner and stop re-litigating the three residuals separately
- Recover: `grep -n "headed\|HEADED" scripts/webmcp-acceptance.ts && sed -n '1,40p' docs/WEBMCP-ACCEPTANCE.md`

The five: **Q11** final extension name and distribution channel (blocks `CAP-FB-20260825-WEBSTORE-RELEASE-01`); **Q12** the recommended default provider for the hub, given Gemini Nano is weak at tool-calling (shapes first-run quality); **Q13** whether a Chrome Web Store build may execute owner-selected local Wasm without violating the remotely-hosted-code policy (blocks `CAP-FB-20260822-OWNER-WASM-INSTALL-01`, currently `BLOCKED`); **Q14** the Co-do licence and provenance reconciliation — Apache-2.0 root against MIT package metadata — which must be settled before any Co-do binary is copied (blocks `CAP-FB-20260822-BUILTIN-WASM-TOOLS-01`); **Q16** grouped tabular artifact promotion — an atomic reservable keyed promotion with refcount and orphan collection, or an explicitly lower single-body cap (blocks `CAP-FB-20260822-TABULAR-DIFF-ARTIFACTS-01`)
- Review: none — these are owner decisions, not reviewable work. An agent may prepare options and trade-offs; it may not decide.
- Gates: each decision written down with its rationale, and each dependent task's `Blockers` field updated to match
- Blockers: requires the product owner. Q13 and Q14 additionally need external input — Chrome Web Store policy wording and the upstream licence position respectively — which an agent can gather and summarise first
- Next: for each of the five, prepare a one-page options-and-consequences summary so the decision is cheap to make; start with Q13 and Q14, which are the two currently holding P0 lanes `BLOCKED`
- Recover: `sed -n '/^## Open/,$p' docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`
- History:
  - 2026-08-25 09:40 UTC — opened so undecided questions are visible in the work queue rather than only in a separate document. Q15 (semantic index engine) is deliberately excluded: `docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md` states it stays inside `CAP-FB-20260820-SEMANTIC-TOOL-SEARCH-01` and must not be duplicated.

## [CAP-FB-20260825-DELEGATE-ATTACHMENTS-PROGRESS-01] Site-agent delegation is text-only
- Feedback: 2026-08-25 — carried as a residual under `CAP-FB-20260818-AGENT-ACCESS-01` since 2026-08-18 with no task of its own; re-verified against current source
- Updated: 2026-08-25 09:40 UTC

- Owner: unassigned
- Workspace: none
- Branch: none
- Base: `784cd7f7275a7f63db856ee4231e523700bc861b`
- Candidate: —
- Shipping: —
- Acceptance: a delegated site-agent run accepts the same attachments a hub run accepts, or states precisely which types it cannot accept and why; the run streams live progress to the delegating surface rather than returning only a final result; the composer stops having to warn that attachments were dropped because they no longer are; delegation keeps its current generation revalidation, preemptive revocation and journal-write fencing unchanged
- Review: independent review that the progress stream cannot leak one origin's run detail into another's surface, and that attachment handling does not widen what a site worker can read
- Gates: unit coverage for attachment pass-through and progress fan-out; a loaded-MV3 delegation showing live progress and a delivered attachment; disenrollment mid-run still discards the journal; concurrent delegations to different origins stay isolated
- Blockers: —
- Next: confirm the intended scope with the owner — full parity with hub runs, or a stated subset — then extend the `agent.delegate` route signature
- Recover: `git grep -n 'async "agent.delegate"' -A 3 -- extension/background/service-worker.js`
- History:
  - 2026-08-25 09:40 UTC — opened. Verified in current source: the `agent.delegate` route signature accepts `origin`, `task`, `threadId` and resume/execution parameters, and has no attachments parameter. `KNOWN-ISSUES.md` has recorded this as a follow-up since 2026-08-18 without an ID.

## [CAP-FB-20260825-CONCURRENCY-RESIDUALS-01] Close the four open concurrency verifications
- Feedback: 2026-08-25 — `KNOWN-ISSUES.md` carries four deep concurrency items each phrased as "verify no residual", none of which has an owner, a test, or a task
- Updated: 2026-08-25 09:40 UTC
- Status: OPEN

- Priority: P2
- Owner: unassigned
- Workspace: none
- Branch: none
- Base: `784cd7f7275a7f63db856ee4231e523700bc861b`
- Candidate: —
- Shipping: —
- Acceptance: each of the four is closed by a failing-then-passing test rather than by inspection — (a) version-scoped CAS in the memory and journal compensation path, checked for remaining ABA windows; (b) the first sync/invoke generation requirement, checked for any residual generationless path; (c) `runGenCells` per-run isolation, checked for residual shared state; (d) MAIN-world cancellation tombstone eviction under sustained load. Anything that turns out not to be reachable is recorded as such with the reasoning, not silently dropped
- Review: independent concurrency review; a test that cannot fail against the pre-fix code proves nothing and must be rejected
- Gates: for each item, a test that fails against a deliberately reverted guard and passes against current source; the full unit suite; `npm run test:security`
- Blockers: —
- Next: start with (d) — tombstone eviction under load is the only one of the four with an unbounded-growth failure mode rather than a correctness one
- Recover: `sed -n '/^### Concurrency edge-cases/,/^### /p' KNOWN-ISSUES.md`
- History:
  - 2026-08-25 09:40 UTC — opened. The fundamental cooperative-cancellation limit documented alongside these four is explicitly **not** in scope: an already-started page side effect cannot be unwound, that is a browser constraint, and it is documented in `docs/DESIGN.md` rather than treated as a defect.

## [CAP-FB-20260825-KEYBOARD-COMMANDS-01] No keyboard shortcuts anywhere
- Feedback: 2026-08-25 — independent gap review found the manifest declares no `commands`, so a power-user tool aimed at people who return to it repeatedly across a day cannot be reached or driven from the keyboard
- Updated: 2026-08-25 14:10 UTC

- Resume: —
- Priority: P2
- Owner: claude-opus-5 implementer session

- Branch: detached candidate on `origin/main`
- Base: `784cd7f7275a7f63db856ee4231e523700bc861b`
- Candidate: this commit
- Shipping: —
- Acceptance: a small, deliberate set of shortcuts — open the hub, start a task, open the side panel, focus the composer — declared in the manifest, remappable through Chrome's own shortcut settings, and discoverable in-product; the set is small enough to be memorable rather than exhaustive; no shortcut fires a destructive or permission-granting action; nothing conflicts with a common browser default
- Review: pending — a different model/session must review the diff plus the 18-check loaded-MV3 evidence, with attention to the two behaviours the acceptance singles out: no command reaches a destructive path, and none can grant a permission
- Gates: 18/18 loaded-MV3 checks on a fresh profile — `chrome.commands.getAll()` reports all three with real bound chords; `#compose` focuses the composer on BOTH the already-open-tab path and the fresh-tab boot path; no command injects task text; the side-panel command finds `sidePanel` ungranted and fails closed without requesting it; Settings lists the chords Chrome actually reports. Plus 6 unit tests, full unit suite, gallery drift, changelog and tasks-schema gates
- Blockers: —
- Next: obtain the independent review; the real OS key chord cannot be fired headless, so pressing it belongs to `CAP-FB-20260825-HEADED-ACCEPTANCE-LANE-01`
- Recover: `git grep -n "KEYBOARD_COMMANDS\|hubUrlForCommand" -- extension && python3 -c "import json;print(json.load(open('extension/manifest.json'))['commands'])"`
- History:
  - 2026-08-25 14:10 UTC — implemented and verified in a real loaded extension. Three commands: `open-hub` (`Alt+Shift+H`), `new-task` (`Alt+Shift+K`, lands on the hub with the composer focused) and `open-side-panel` (`Alt+Shift+S`). The acceptance named four; "start a task" and "focus the composer" collapse into the same action, so shipping a fourth redundant chord was rejected rather than padded to match the wording.
  - 2026-08-25 14:10 UTC — **the browser run caught two real defects that source review would not have.** (1) Chrome SILENTLY DROPPED `Alt+Shift+A`, `Alt+Shift+N`, `Alt+Shift+T` and `Alt+Shift+C` — a dropped `suggested_key` produces no error and no binding, so the shortcuts would simply never have fired. The shipped chords were chosen by probing what Chrome actually binds, not by reading a reserved-key list. (2) `#compose` did nothing when a hub tab was already open: setting the hash is a `push` navigation and `shouldDispatchForNavigationType` deliberately suppresses those, so the router never saw it. A `hashchange` listener now handles that one focus-only route; it touches no view state, so it cannot race the dispatcher.
  - 2026-08-25 14:10 UTC — constraints enforced in code, not just documented: no command is destructive; none calls `chrome.permissions.request` (a key chord is not a gesture aimed at a specific grant, so a prompt from one would be a consent dark pattern); the side-panel command checks `permissions.contains` and fails closed with an actionable diagnostic; no command carries a payload, so a shortcut can never inject task text. Settings renders `chrome.commands.getAll()` rather than the manifest's suggested keys, so it stays truthful after an owner remaps or clears a binding.
  - 2026-08-25 12:30 UTC — ownership: unassigned → claude-opus-5 implementer session (taking the lane; no other session is on it per the 00:14 fleet board)
  - 2026-08-25 09:40 UTC — opened. Verified absent: `extension/manifest.json` contains no `commands` key.

## [CAP-FB-20260825-I18N-FOUNDATION-01] No internationalisation foundation
- Feedback: 2026-08-25 — independent gap review found no `_locales` directory and no `default_locale`; every user-visible string is hardcoded English across the hub, Settings, side panel, chat and components
- Updated: 2026-08-25 09:40 UTC
- Status: OPEN
- Resume: —
- Priority: P2
- Owner: unassigned
- Workspace: none
- Branch: none
- Base: `784cd7f7275a7f63db856ee4231e523700bc861b`
- Candidate: —
- Shipping: —
- Acceptance: a `default_locale` and an `_locales/en` message catalogue exist; user-visible strings resolve through the catalogue rather than being hardcoded, including strings inside the shared Web Components; the component gallery renders identically after the migration; adding a second locale requires only a new catalogue and no code change. Shipping additional translations is explicitly **not** in scope — this task is the foundation only
- Review: independent review that no string escapes the catalogue and that the gallery drift guard still holds
- Gates: `npm run check:gallery` no drift; `npm run test:components`; the Chrome journey suite green — the journeys assert on visible text, so this migration is exactly the kind of change that breaks them silently; a grep-based inventory of remaining hardcoded user-visible strings with each survivor justified
- Blockers: this touches nearly every surface at once and will conflict with any concurrent UI lane. Sequence it deliberately — do not start it alongside an open UI task
- Next: produce the string inventory and decide whether the migration is worth doing before a name and distribution decision, or after
- Recover: `ls extension/_locales 2>/dev/null || echo absent; grep -n "default_locale" extension/manifest.json || echo absent`
- History:
  - 2026-08-25 09:40 UTC — opened as a foundation task, not a translation project. Priority reflects that it blocks nothing today but gets more expensive with every surface added.

## [CAP-FB-20260825-AGENT-PICKER-HUB-ROWS-01] Hub agent summary rows predate the shared picker
- Feedback: 2026-08-25 — carried as a residual under `CAP-FB-20260818-AGENT-ACCESS-01` since 2026-08-18 with no task of its own; re-verified against current source

- Candidate: —
- Shipping: —
- Acceptance: the hub's Named, Background and Site agent summary rows are expressed through the same shared agent component the rest of the product uses, so the three lists gain live registry updates and consistent behaviour for free; visible behaviour and the surfaces the rows open are unchanged; the component is exercised in the gallery
- Review: independent visual and behavioural review that nothing regressed — this is a consistency change and must not become a redesign
- Gates: `npm run check:gallery`; `npm run test:components`; `scripts/sidebar-parity.ts`; loaded-MV3 before/after screenshots of all three lists in expanded, collapsed and RTL layouts
- Blockers: `AGENTS.md` requires new UI to be a reusable component in the single-source components file and names hand-rolled duplicates as the cause of past bugs — this is the last known instance of that pattern in the hub
- Next: confirm the shared component covers the three summary presentations before changing anything; if it does not, extend it rather than forking it
- Recover: `git grep -c "capability-row" -- extension/ntp/ntp.js && git grep -c "agent-picker" -- extension/ntp/ntp.js`

## [CAP-FB-20260825-TRACKER-INTEGRITY-01] Enforce the tracker's own entry schema
- Feedback: 2026-08-25 — a gap sweep found three entries violating the schema this file defines: two headings with no body at all, and one heading carrying three complete field sets with conflicting statuses

- Candidate: this commit
- Shipping: —
- Acceptance: `CAP-FB-20260822-WASI-FDSTAT-FLAGS-01` is resolved — it holds **three** field sets under one heading (`DONE`, `IN_REVIEW`, `DONE`), so its real state is unreadable and any tool or reader gets a different answer depending on which one it takes. The 2026-08-25 archive split read only the first and moved it to `TASKS-DONE.md`, so a field set reading `IN_REVIEW` is now filed as completed work. Either split it into distinct IDs for the distinct pieces of work, or reconcile it to a single authoritative field set with the superseded history moved into `History`. Separately, a check runs in CI and fails when any heading does not carry exactly one of each schema field, when a `Status` or `Priority` value is outside the declared set, or when a `CAP-FB` ID is duplicated or reused across `TASKS.md` and `TASKS-DONE.md`
- Review: pending — a different model/session must review the FDSTAT split (that the three field sets went to the right entries and no field value changed) and the gate script
- Gates: the schema check run against the current file, demonstrated failing on a deliberately malformed entry and passing on the corrected file; the `Open work queue` index regenerated and matching the checker's output exactly
- Blockers: —
- Next: obtain the independent review; then burn down `scripts/check-tasks-baseline.json` from 37 as the owning lanes touch their entries
- Recover: `awk '/^## \[CAP-FB/{id=$0} /^- Status:/{print id}' TASKS.md TASKS-DONE.md | uniq -c | awk '$1!=1'`
- History:
  - 2026-08-25 12:55 UTC — **root cause found and repaired.** The three field sets under the `CAP-FB-20260822-WASI-FDSTAT-FLAGS-01` heading were not duplicates: they were the missing bodies of the two headings that had none. The `IN_REVIEW` set is verbatim `CAP-FB-20260822-WASM-EXECUTION-HOST-02` (Gate-2 recomposed source, branch `recompose/gate2-6662dfa`, candidate `086ee3d`) and the `DONE` set is verbatim `CAP-FB-20260822-WASM-EXECUTION-HOST-01` (pure WASI host contract, shipped `462d21d`). Each was moved to its own heading with no field value altered, replacing the conservative placeholders written on 2026-08-25 09:40. `-02` is therefore genuinely `IN_REVIEW` with real reviewed work behind it, not the unknown-scope `BLOCKED` recorded earlier. A stray `- Next:` line describing `086ee3d` had also been dropped mid-Gates inside the `-01` text; it moved to `-02` where its candidate lives. FDSTAT now carries exactly one field set, describing `fd_fdstat_set_flags` only, with its own fields unchanged.
  - 2026-08-25 12:55 UTC — gate landed: `scripts/check-tasks.mjs` / `npm run check:tasks`, proven to fail on both real defects (a body-less heading and the three-field-set entry) and to pass on the repaired files. 37 violations predating the gate are baselined rather than mass-edited, because they sit in entries owned by live lanes; the gate is strict for anything new. `Resume` is now required only on `BLOCKED` entries — it was omitted on 23 entries, which is the fleet having already voted against requiring it everywhere.
  - 2026-08-25 12:30 UTC — ownership: unassigned → claude-opus-5 implementer session (taking the lane; documentation/tooling only, no code-lane collision)
  - 2026-08-25 09:40 UTC — opened. The two empty headings (`CAP-FB-20260822-WASM-EXECUTION-HOST-01` and `-02`) were recovered in this same commit and are not part of this task; the FDSTAT merged-heading defect and the missing check are.

## [CAP-FB-20260822-WASM-EXECUTION-HOST-02] Gate 2 source-only fresh-Worker host (recomposed)
- Feedback: 2026-08-22 — the reviewed package host needs hard termination,
  byte-bounded sync workspaces, an audit-before-instantiate scan and a bounded
  result envelope before any route can reach it
- Updated: 2026-08-22 20:30 UTC
- Status: IN_REVIEW

- Base: `6662dfa2870ef1729b7e3ba68c3393d40f7db474`
- Candidate: this commit (`086ee3d` PASSed source, renumbered `0.2.159`)
- Shipping: —
- Acceptance: the recomposed source tree preserves the PASSed Gate-2 facts —
  synchronous per-job workspace, audit-before-instantiate, the exact 15-key
  result envelope with bounded stdout/stderr content, one finish() for
  timeout/abort, scanner-owned execution-host exemption (fixed canonical path
  + exact call shape) and the scanner-owned worker-host exemption (the one
  non-literal fresh-Worker construction); executor/offscreen host remain
  UNREACHABLE source-only until a separately reviewed route successor lands
- Review: the recomposed source PASSed independent review as `086ee3d`; that exact object was renumbered to the `0.2.159`/`0.2.160` landing, so the recorded candidate is not an ancestor of main and the review verdict is not yet bound to a reachable commit
- Gates: final independent review PASS on `086ee3d` (26/26 focused, full
  1056/1056, build rc 0); recomposed gates re-run on this commit

- History:
  - 2026-08-25 12:30 UTC — recovered by `CAP-FB-20260825-TRACKER-INTEGRITY-01`. This field set had been concatenated under the `CAP-FB-20260822-WASI-FDSTAT-FLAGS-01` heading, which carried three complete field sets while this entry's own heading carried none. Restored verbatim; no field value was altered by the move.
  - 2026-08-22 20:40 UTC — Store package scan after the recomposed push passed
    ABSOLUTE source paths to the scanner; the canonical exemptions compared only
    relative paths and flagged the execution-host Wasm + worker-host Worker
    constructions. Fixed with a scanner-owned canonical path matcher
    (`isCanonicalScannedPath`) that accepts the exact normalized repo tail
    (relative or absolute) and rejects lookalikes/suffix tricks; added
    absolute-positive + lookalike-negative tests for BOTH exemptions. Store
    package build/package/validate pass on `0.2.160`.
- Blockers: the recorded candidate `086ee3d` is not an ancestor of `origin/main`; the Gate-2 semantics it carries are byte-contained on main at `aca0759` under the renumbered landing, so the candidate reference must be reconciled before this entry can advance
- Next: the Gate-2 semantics (wasm-execution-worker/executor/bounds/offscreen-host/sync-workspace + the scanner-owned canonical exemptions) are byte-contained on main at aca0759; the recorded candidate 086ee3d is NOT an ancestor (renumbered to the 0.2.159/0.2.160 landing). Next action: reconcile the Candidate field to the renumbered tip, confirm the supersession, then advance to MERGED.
